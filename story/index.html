          The UAE offers some amazing conditions for surfing and kitesurfing. The
          biggest challenge is knowing when it is going to work because the storms
          are irregular and difficult to predict and therefore the forecasting
          tools that we have available to us in this region are often unreliable.
          After 16 years of being in the UAE, I can tell you that the only way to
          know whether it is working or not is to get down to the beach and see
          for yourself. That either leads to stoke, or disappointment - with the
          latter being more frequent than we'd all like.

          Tim's Reef on the east coast is a magical spot. The swell approaches
          from the SE and the reef is well positioned to receive it. The east
          coast doesn't get swell often, but when storms/winds are strong enough
          it does surprise us. Being a 2-hour drive from Dubai, it is too
          unpredictable to risk the journey unless you have proof of the
          conditions which is why people will only go if a) the forecast is really
          solid or b) they see a picture of the conditions.

          Being fortunate enough to be self-employed and to live in Sharjah, I'm a
          bit closer to Fujairah - I can get there in 1hr 20min whenever I see a
          gap and a potential swell. And you'd be surprised how often there is
          little swell even though nothing was predicted. There have been some
          beautiful days where I have surfed alone with no one around - but there
          have also been many disappointments when I drove all the way for
          nothing. And so was born the goal to improve the forecasting and
          monitoring tools... to result in a better stoke vs disappointment ratio.

          After a lot of research I decided that I would invest some money into a
          portable weather station which would not only help me, but the
          community. There was no out-the-box solution but i stumbled across a
          route that was open source with lots of flexibility and that was enough
          to inspire me. Next, i met with the guys from the Dive Centre at Sandy
          Beach Hotel (which is 200m down the road from Tim's Reef) and they were
          kind enough to support and help me get an approval to host the
          station/camera at the hotel.

          I purchased the parts and experimented late into the night with lines of
          code (and even formatted the HDD of my iMac unintentionally in the
          process) but I eventually got a basic station operational and remotely
          manageable.

          Hoffie and I did a few trips down to Sandy Beach Hotel to do the
          installation. The camera and remote management proved to be pretty
          stable but the weather sensor wasn't performing well and was losing
          signal often. At the same time I was working on an interface to view all
          of the information that was being aquired from different sources. One of
          the biggest challenges was live video - which is heavy on processing
          power and data transmission, and to be honest it is an overkill. I
          started experimenting with timelapses and found it was a lot more
          reliable and lighter on data and the cpu. Eventually i settled on a
          single picture every 5-minutes which works well... the long term plan is
          to create a gallery which will show past pictures as well.

          Made some modifications to the sensor settings and things are working
          much better now.
